## How to Apply Low Contrast Dark Mode Site Skin

1. From the AO3 home page, hover over your account name in the top right of the screen and click `My Dashboard`
2. In the sidebar on the lefthand side of your dashboard view, click `Skins`
3. On the far right, click `Create Site Skin`
4. Select `Site Skin` as the type and pick a title for your skin. Note that AO3 requires site skin names to be unique, so I'd recommend naming it something like `[Your Account Name]'s Low Contrast Dark Mode`
5. In the [low_contrast_dark_mode.css](https://github.com/phyrelink/ao3-site-skins/blob/main/low_contrast_dark_mode.css) file, click the `Copy raw file` button (the one that looks like two overlapping squares). Then, in the `CSS` box of your `Create New Skin` page on AO3, paste the contents of the CSS file
6. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click `Submit`. This should bring you to a page that contains the title, description and preview (if you added one), and CSS code of the skin that you just created. Scroll down to the bottom of this page and click `Use` to apply the site skin
8. Happy reading!
